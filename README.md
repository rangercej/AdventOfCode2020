# AdventOfCode 2020

Using AoC as a set of exercises for first forays into F#. As a result, some of 
this code is likely not going to be idiomatic F#. Maybe this'll improve as the
exercises/challenges go on. Either way, interesting to poke a new language :-)

I started these challenges a few days late, first one written and passed on 6th
December, so currently playing catchup over the next few days.
